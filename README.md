## **My Favorite Series of K-drama**
- **The Heirs**

> **The Heirs series** is about a group of wealthy, privileged high school students as they are about to take over their families' business empires, overcoming difficulties and growing every step of the way, and also a love triangle love story.

| Character | Description |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Lee Min-ho | Protagonist | 
| Park Shi-hye | Protagonist |
| Kim Woo-bin | Antagonist |

- **Hapiness**
  
> **Happiness series** is a dystopian drama that feels, nevertheless, close to home. The drama doesn't focus too much on the horror aspect, with the zombie-like disease, that could have been easily overused with loads of gory scenes and bloodbath. 

| Character | Description |

| Han Hyo-joo | Protagonist | 
| Park Hyung-sik | Protagonist |
| Jo Woo-jin | Antagonist |

- **Crash Landing On You**
  
> **Crash Landing On You series** is about the romance and the drama are all successfully blended. Love the ongoing comedy about the differences between North and South Korea - all freshly done and spot on. Neither side is spared or treated unfairly. The farewells are heartbreaking and the romantic scenes are unforgettable.
